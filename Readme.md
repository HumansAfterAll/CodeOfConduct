# *The Code of Conduct Among all Human Beings*

-- by Romeo Disca, *March, 1st 2025* --

This code of conduct ruleset is the ubiquitous minimal requirement upon a contract between the parties you, me, and others and throughout their interactions.

Human actions manifest directly or inderectly in the environment they live in. Therefore, if the participants of this code of conduct comply to these three simple rules, then its impact will be shown throught their environment. As a consequence, eventually, humanity will save its kind in a prolific environment, also known as, the world surrounding us.

The rules are,

- *Rule #0* - General Rule
- *Rule #1* - The Aggreement
- *Rule #2* - Violation of *RULE #1*
